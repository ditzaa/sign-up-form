# sign-up-form
Sign-Up Form Project

I built this project to apply my intermediate HTML and CSS concepts (advanced selectors, custom properties, forms, etc.) learned in the Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service, focusing on layout structure, styling techniques, and basic form validation.

##Technologies Used
- HTML (for structuring the form and page elements);
- CSS (for styling and layout adjustments);
- Git (for version control).


## Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/signup-form.git
cd signup-form

To view the project, simply open index.html in a web browser.
