# sign-up-form
Sign-Up Form Project

Introduction

I built this project to apply my intermediate HTML and CSS concepts (advanced selectors, custom properties, forms, etc.) learned in the Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service, focusing on layout structure, styling techniques, and basic form validation.

Technologies Used

HTML (for structuring the form and page elements)

CSS (for styling and layout adjustments)

Git (for version control)

How to Clone and Run the Project

# Clone the repository
